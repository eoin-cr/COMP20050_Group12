# COMP20050_Group12
## Some ideas:
- We use ascii codes to colour terminal blocks.
- Note that we can represent hexagons as rectangles
without losing data about which sides are touching
- Use a 2d array of tiles to store their locations?
- When the user plays we can draw the possible tiles
they can place at around the actually placed tiles,
and number them so the user can choose where to put
the tile by entering the number
- Try to modularise a lot by using a lot of helper
methods.  Will make it easier to change the way things
work in the future.

## What I've added in this commit
- Made a start on the drawing method
- Created a tile class with a habitats enum
